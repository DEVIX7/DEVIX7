# Three people have left our team, and now there are only a few of us left (2.5 individuals). We are considering the possibility of recovering the departed scripts. We believe that "DEVIX7" will no longer be a team, and we will continue to carry out tasks under a unified name, not identifying ourselves as a team. We will simply revert everything to how it was before April 2023, and "DEVIX7" will return to the hands of the founder. 
## Note: almost all repositories were created by one person (the founder).
